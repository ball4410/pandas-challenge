Observed Trends:

The top perfoming schools are all charter schools. Notice that none of the top performing schools fall into the highest spenging category. This could imply that the budget spent per student does not impact performance as much as teaching approaches, standards, standard testing etc.

The bottom performing scools are mostly high and couple medium sized schools. This could imply the average student to teacher ratio is greater in these low performing schools. Student performance can be negatively affected since there is less opportunity for one-on-one time their instructors.
